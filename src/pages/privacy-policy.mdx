      # Privacy Policy

      **Effective date:** January 1, 2025

      Your privacy matters to everyone at St. George Pizza. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it across our digital touchpoints and in-person experiences.

      ## Information we collect

      We collect personal details that you share when placing an order, requesting a reservation, purchasing a gift card, or contacting our team. This may include your name, email address, phone number, and any notes you provide about dietary preferences or event needs.

      ## How we use your data

      We only use your information to deliver the services you requested, such as confirming reservations, providing delivery updates, or sharing news you opted into. We never sell guest information and only share it with trusted partners when necessary to fulfill your request.

      ## Safeguarding your information

      We retain data only as long as needed to serve you, and we store it within commercially accepted security standards. Access is limited to trained team members, and we regularly audit our systems to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.

      ## Your choices

      You can decline to share personal information, understanding that certain services may become unavailable. You may also update or request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us at [privacy@stgeorgepizza.com](mailto:privacy@stgeorgepizza.com).

      ## Third-party services

      Our site may link to other websites we do not control. Please review the privacy practices for those sites separately, as we cannot guarantee their policies.

      ## Questions

      If you have questions about this policy or how we handle personal information, reach our team at [hello@stgeorgepizza.com](mailto:hello@stgeorgepizza.com) or call **(435) 555-5555**.
